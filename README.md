## Chrome extension to quote Trove newspaper text ##

The [Trove Newspaper site](http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper?q=) allows users
to correct newspaper OCR text for historical Australian Newspapers.

When quoting newspaper text for research purposes it is useful to quote the
newspaper title, date and page. This extension enables a 'Cite Trove' context
menu item that adds your selected text and configurable newspaper information
to the clipboard. This text is then available for pasting into other
applications.
